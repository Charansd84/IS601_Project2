      <h3 style="background-color:Yellow;">Object oriented programming in Python</h3>
      <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a method of structuring a program by bundling related properties and behaviors into individual objects. In this tutorial, you’ll learn the basics of object-oriented programming in Python.</p>

<p>Conceptually, objects are like the components of a system. Think of a program as a factory assembly line of sorts. At each step of the assembly line a system component processes some material, ultimately transforming raw material into a finished product.</p>

<p>An object contains data, like the raw or preprocessed materials at each step on an assembly line, and behavior, like the action each assembly line component performs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3 style="background-color:Green;">Instantiation</h3>
      <p> In a computer system, any time a new context is created based on some model, it is said that the model has been instantiated. In practice, this instance usually has a data structure in common with other instances, but the values stored in the instances are separate.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3 style="background-color:Salmon;">Object in Python</h3>
      <p>An object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on those data. Similarly, a class is a blueprint for that object. We can think of a class as a sketch (prototype) of a house.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3 style="background-color:Coral;">Class in Python</h3>
      <p>A Python class is like an outline for creating a new object. An object is anything that you wish to manipulate or change while working through the code. Every time a class object is instantiated, which is when we declare a variable, a new object is initiated from scratch. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3 style="background-color:Khaki;">NameSpace</h3>
      <p>In computing, a namespace is a set of signs that are used to identify and refer to objects of various kinds. A namespace ensures that all of a given set of objects have unique names so that they can be easily identified. Namespaces are commonly structured as hierarchies to allow reuse of names in different contexts.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3 style="background-color:Red;">Constructor</h3>
      <p>In class-based object-oriented programming, a constructor is a special type of subroutine called to create an object. It prepares the new object for use, often accepting arguments that the constructor uses to set required member variables.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3 style="background-color:Plum;">Fixture</h3>
      <p>In testing, a fixture provides a defined, reliable and consistent context for the tests. This could include environment (for example a database configured with known parameters) or content (such as a dataset).

Fixtures define the steps and data that constitute the arrange phase of a test (see Anatomy of a test). In pytest, they are functions you define that serve this purpose. They can also be used to define a test’s act phase; this is a powerful technique for designing more complex tests.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3 style="background-color:Magenta;">Type Hint</h3>
      <p>Type hinting is a formal solution to statically indicate the type of a value within your Python code</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3 style="background-color:Purple;">Type Casting</h3>
      <p>Type conversion (or typecasting) means transfer of data from one data type to another. Implicit conversion happens when the compiler automatically assigns data types, but the source code can also explicitly require a conversion to take place.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3 style="background-color:Indigo;">Unit Testing</h3>
      <p>Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually and independently scrutinized for proper operation. This testing methodology is done during the development process by the software developers and sometimes QA staff.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3 style="background-color:lime;">Static Property</h3>
      <p>The absence of the keyword "static" might be misleading, but any object initialised inside the class (just one indent inside the class, and not in the constructor) is static. It is not dependent on instantiation (because it is not part of the constructor).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3 style="background-color:Green;">Inheritance</h3>
      <p>Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system). The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3 style="background-color:olive;">Encapsulation</h3>
      <p>By definition, encapsulation describes the idea of bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit, like a class in Java. This concept is also often used to hide the internal representation, or state of an object from the outside. This is called information hiding.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3 style="background-color:Teal;">Polymorphism</h3>
      <p>Polymorphism is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) and describes situations in which something occurs in several different forms. In computer science, it describes the concept that you can access objects of different types through the same interface.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3 style="background-color:Blue;">Abstraction</h3>
        <p>In software engineering and computer science, abstraction is: The process of removing physical, spatial, or temporal details or attributes in the study of objects </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3 style="background-color:Navy;">SOLID</h3>
      <p>SOLID is an acronym that stands for five key design principles: single responsibility principle, open-closed principle, Liskov substitution principle, interface segregation principle, and dependency inversion principle. All five are commonly used by software engineers and provide some important benefits for developers. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3 style="background-color:Tan;">Design Patterns</h3>
      <p>In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code.</p>
